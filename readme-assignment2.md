# Self-Grade Sheet -  Zach Filla (M11078030)

- Create a JFrame form/class with a main method and appropriate layout. 10/10
- Collect data from form, populate Account, add to Vector.  10/10
- Override the toString() method of Account and subclasses, and/or use Lombok. 10/10
- JList is bound to the Vector of accounts, and the List updates its display automatically as the accounts update. 10/10
- Use a Factory method with Class.forName().newInstance() to create account subclass objects. 10/10
  - (Note: I'm using the same factory from the previous assignment but I'm not sure if it was actually supposed to be changed. Either way, it still works. If this was supposed to be changed, then this should be 5/10)
- Create JComboBox with all Account Type options. 10/10
- Term or Maturity field exists, and is only available when Certificate of Deposit is selected. 10/10
- Compute button exists, and List updates automatically when pressed. 10/10
- Did something extra, beyond the minimum requirements listed here. 10/10
  - You MUST state what you did to earn credit for this item:
    - Added basic input validation for the text input fields to prevent errors from blank strings. Shows warning popup if blanks are found.
- Code in good form, and follows best practices. 10/10
