## Description

This is a simple "banking" program that allows users to deposit money or import existing accounts, set various configuration settings (interest, terms, periods, type of account), calculate interest, create reports of the generated interest, and then withdraw from the accounts. This program was written in Java and utilizes Swing GUI for the user interface. The UML class diagram is shown below.

## Note to Summer

When you add the Class diagram, make sure you also update the Self-Grade sheet below with the rest of your contributions' score / grades! To make them easier to find, I marked them with this guy here -> ðŸ”´

## Self-Grade Sheet

Submit this self-grade sheet along with your project.

- Have a GitHub repository, with commits from all teammates.
- This repository should have a README.md describes your project. 10/10
- Create a class diagram in draw.io and include it in your README.md 10/10
- Start with the program that collects accounts.
- Initialize your accounts by reading the provided JSON file, accounts.json Download accounts.json.  Allow the user to create additional accounts with the GUI. 10/10
- Do not allow the user to create duplicate accounts, or duplicate account numbers. 10/10
  - Add an account number attribute to class Account, and a corresponding field to the GUI.
  - Place all used account numbers in a Set.
  - When the user enters an account, validate that it is not currently in the Set of account numbers.
- Allow the user to withdraw money from accounts.  Start by withdrawing from the account that pays the lowest interest
  - Adjust the GUI to allow withrdawls.  10/10
  - Place accounts in a priority queue, based on rate.
  - Use Comparator/compareTo to compare rates.  10/10
  - Allow partial withdraws from accounts; simply update principle.
- Report total interest earned, across all accounts, for a given period. 10/10
  - Iterate over the collection.  Compute interest earned.  Store interest earned from each account in a collection (ArrayList, etc.)  Iterate and sum.
- Test your work. 10/10
  - Write unit tests to cover the cases above.
  - Ensure they run with GitHub actions.  
- Code is in good form, and conforms to best practices.  Classes and public methods contain JavaDoc. __/10 ðŸ”´
- Do something extra, beyond the minimum requirements stated here.  10/10
  - What did you do?  Must list to earn credit.
    - Allowed users to import their own json file of accounts.
